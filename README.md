# **English by Carmen**

## **Code Institute Milestone Project 1**

![Project Mockup](/assets/images/Project_Mockup.png)

English by Carmen is a website for Carmen Galati. She is an English teacher living in The Netherlands. The website has several things to offer, both to students and to Carmen. I came to this idea because Carmen would very much like to have her own website on which she can provide her students with course materials and excercises. Other than that, on this website she wants to offer several classes-packages to potential students and educational institutions. Finally, the website is a means of providing information about herself and by using a form, users can contact her for further information.

This is the first of four milestone projects of The Code Institute's _Full Stack Software Developer_ program. The main goal is to make a static but responsive website consisting of a minimum of three pages with the use of HTML5 and CSS.

## **UX**

### **Project Goals**

- To create a functional website for Carmen, serving as a platform for sharing information between both her current students as well as potential students or educational institutions.
- To create a website that is designed in a way that it looks professional, is visually attractive and intuitive and easy to use.
- To create a responsive website so that it can be used on a variety of devices.


### **User Stories**

- As a user I want to be able to easily navigate through the website's pages and find relevant information in an intuitive way.
- As a student  I want to be able to find information about English grammar and exercises.
- As a potential client I want to be able to find relevant information about the classes-packages Carmen has to offer and the investments required for them.
- Both as a student or future client I want to get some personal information about Carmen. Her qualifications, language skills, her working history and the like.
- As a user I want to be able to contact her so I can get in touch with her and ask her for further information about her services provided.


### **Design Process**

I began the design process by deciding which pages the website should consist of. I created a workspace on Figma, an application for wireframing websites which was suggested by my mentor Seun Owonikoko. The first page would be the 'Home' page with a large hero image and four subjects linking to more information about English grammar. These links won't work yet, but are to be developed in a future edition of the website. In the top left corner of every page is a logo. Clicking on this logo brings the user back to the 'Home' page. The yellow circular banner as well as the logo were designed and provided to me by Carmen.

The second page is the 'Classes' page where information can be found about the different classes-packages offered by Carmen. The images of the three different classes were also designed and provided to me by Carmen. As a background colour I decided to use a neutral beige colour to mark the section containing the classes-packages. This colour doesn't distract the user of the actual content (i.e. the classes-packages), complements the rest of the page and is easy on the eye as well.

The third page is the 'Contact' page. On this page there is a form where users can fill in their data and send Carmen a message. On the background of this page I used the same hero image as I did on the 'Home' page, as this image is quite neutral and by making it a little transparent it shouldn't disturb the users when using the form. At the same time it makes the form stand out from the page's background.

At the top of each page there is a navigation bar containing links to the different pages of the website, making navigation through the website easy and obvious. At the bottom of every page I made a link to Carmen's social media account, in this case her Instagram account.

Throughout the coding process I tried to stick to the original design as much as possible although I didn't manage to replicate it exactly.


### **Wireframing my project on Figma**
![Design Figma](/assets/images/MP1_Design_Figma.png)

Wireframing my project on Figma turned out to be very, very time consuming. So much in fact that I didn't make wireframes anymore for the 'Classes' and 'Contact' pages for both tablet and mobile devices the way I wanted them to be. I also made wireframes for additional 'About me' and 'Gallery' pages that I initially planned to make as well. However, this proved to be far too ambitious given the time left available and therefore I had to skip those pages for the final website.
The entire workspace can be viewed on Figma using this [link](https://www.figma.com/file/1qGKRqqQxubsCCzua76Gbb/Milestone-Project-1?node-id=19%3A1).


## **Features**

### **Consistent features across all three pages**
- A navigation bar at the top, containing links to the other pages.
- A footer ribbon containing a link to Carmen's Instagram account.
- A logo which brings the user back to the 'Home' page.

### **Home**
Four subjects which in the future will lead to corresponding pages containing information about English grammar and useful exercises.

### **Classes**
Providing information about the different classes-packages Carmen has to offer.

### **Contact**
The 'Contact' page contains a form in which a user can leave their name, email address and write a message for Carmen which, in a future version of the website, will be directly sent to Carmen. The submit/”Ask Carmen” button turns blue when hovered over.

### **Features left to implement**
- As mentioned before, on the 'Home' page additional pages have to be made containing additional information about the subjects (i.e. Tenses, Word Order, Conditionals, Phrasal Verbs).
- On the 'Classes' page an extra “Ask Carmen”-button leading to the 'Contact' page needs to be made.
- On the 'Contact' page a message should appear in case not all fields are filled in and another message should appear to confirm that the message has been sent.
- 'About me' and a 'Gallery' pages. The 'About me' page shall contain detailed information about Carmen's qualifications, language skills and working history. The 'Gallery page' shall contain reviews from students and a link to her (fictional) YouTube channel.


### **Fonts**

The fonts were taken from [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).
- “Amatic SC” is used for the subtitle and the subjects on the 'Home' page, the menu items in the navigation bar and the text in the footer ribbon. This font matches the font that is used in the circular banner on the 'Home' page and was requested to use in this way by Carmen.
- “Caveat” is used in the logo in the upper left side and on the 'Contact' page above the form. These are all texts that call to the user of the website. The other font, used in the form is the standard one that is provided by Bootstrap.


### **Icons**

The Instagram icon I used in the footer ribbon was taken from the [Fontawesome](https://fontawesome.com/) website.


## **Technologies used**
- HTML5: for creating the content of the pages
- CSS: for styling the content of the pages
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/):
for applying Bootstrap's container system to make the website responsive and usable on different screen sizes
for the navigation/menu bar at the top of each page
for the form on the 'Contact' page
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/): for creating wireframes of the individual pages
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/): for the Instagram icon
- [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/): for the different fonts I used for the website
- [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/): the hero image ('Green Chameleon' @craftedbygc) on the 'Home' and 'Contact' page was derived from this website
- [W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/): for testing the HTML and CSS code

## **Communities used:**
Code Institute's Tutor support
Code Institute's channel on Stack Overflow


## **Testing**
### **User stories**
- Based on the user stories stated above, clicking on the items in the menu bar leads the user to the desired pages.
- The subject on the 'Home' page are clickable. They should lead the user to respective pages as soon as they are developed.
- The 'Classes' page contains detailed information about the classes-packages.
- Personal information about Carmen is not available yet, however this should be available in a future edition of the website.
- A user of the website is able to contact Carmen by filling in the contact form on the 'Contact' page.

### **Responsiveness**
Every page is responsive both on landscape and portrait positions. Buttons work well and design worked as expected on mobile, tablet and desktop screen sizes. They were tested using Google Developer Tools.

### **Different browsers**
Every page works wel on different browsers. They were tested on Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Mozilla Firefox.

### **Validating the HTML and CSS code**
The code written for this website passed the [HTML W3C Markup Validation Service](https://validator.w3.org/) and the [CSS W3C Markup Validation Service](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator).


## **Deployment**

### **Deploying my project**

My project was created on Github and I have used Gitpod's development environment to write the project's code. My project had to be deployed in order to be viewed by other people. I used the following process to do so:

1. from my Github page I clicked on the 'Settings' link,
2. on the next page, I scrolled down to the 'GitHub Pages' section,
3. I chose 'master branch' as my Source,
4. after that my website was deployed on GitHub Pages allowing me to share my website with other people.

### **Cloning my project**

It is possible for others to work on my project. To do so, it should be cloned to a local machine using the following steps:

1. at the top of my repository page, click on the 'Code' button,
2. choose between the different options of cloning my project and click the 'Clone' button on the right of the address in the pop-up window,
3. open your terminal,
4. change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory,
5. type 'git clone', and then paste the URL you copied earlier,
6. press 'Enter' to create your local clone.

The above process was found in this website: [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/cloning-a-repository). A lot more information about cloning a repository can be found there as well.
